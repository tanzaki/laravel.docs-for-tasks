## Basic Routing

The most basic Laravel routes simply accept a URI and a `Closure`, providing a very simple and expressive method of defining routes:

    Route::get('foo', function () {
        return 'Hello World';
    });

#### The Default Route Files

All Laravel routes are defined in your route files, which are located in the `routes` directory. These files are automatically loaded by the framework. The `routes/web.php` file defines routes that are for your web interface. These routes are assigned the `web` middleware group, which provides features like session state and CSRF protection. The routes in `routes/api.php` are stateless and are assigned the `api` middleware group.

For most applications, you will begin by defining routes in your `routes/web.php` file. The routes defined in `routes/web.php` may be accessed by entering the defined route's URL in your browser. For example, you may access the following route by navigating to `http://your-app.dev/user` in your browser:

    Route::get('/user', 'UsersController@index');

Routes defined in the `routes/api.php` file are nested within a route group by the `RouteServiceProvider`. Within this group, the `/api` URI prefix is automatically applied so you do not need to manually apply it to every route in the file. You may modify the prefix and other route group options by modifying your `RouteServiceProvider` class.

#### Available Router Methods

The router allows you to register routes that respond to any HTTP verb:

    Route::get($uri, $callback);
    Route::post($uri, $callback);
    Route::put($uri, $callback);
    Route::delete($uri, $callback);

Sometimes you may need to register a route that responds to multiple HTTP verbs. You may do so using the `match` method. Or, you may even register a route that responds to all HTTP verbs using the `any` method:

    Route::match(['get', 'post'], '/', function () {
        //
    });

    Route::any('foo', function () {
        //
    });

#### CSRF Protection

Any HTML forms pointing to `POST`, `PUT`, or `DELETE` routes that are defined in the `web` routes file should include a CSRF token field. Otherwise, the request will be rejected. You can read more about CSRF protection in the [CSRF documentation](/docs/{{version}}/csrf):

    <form method="POST" action="/profile">
        {{ csrf_field() }}
        ...
    </form>

## Route Parameters

### Required Parameters

Of course, sometimes you will need to capture segments of the URI within your route. For example, you may need to capture a user's ID from the URL. You may do so by defining route parameters:

    Route::get('user/{id}', function ($id) {
        return 'User '.$id;
    });

You may define as many route parameters as required by your route:

    Route::get('posts/{post}/comments/{comment}', function ($postId, $commentId) {
        //
    });

Route parameters are always encased within `{}` braces and should consist of alphabetic characters, and may not contain a `-` character. Instead of using the `-` character, use an underscore (`_`) instead. Route parameters are injected into route callbacks / controllers based on their order - the names of the callback / controller arguments do not matter.

## Named Routes

Named routes allow the convenient generation of URLs or redirects for specific routes. You may specify a name for a route by chaining the `name` method onto the route definition:

    Route::get('user/profile', function () {
        //
    })->name('profile');

You may also specify route names for controller actions:

    Route::get('user/profile', 'UserController@showProfile')->name('profile');

#### Generating URLs To Named Routes

Once you have assigned a name to a given route, you may use the route's name when generating URLs or redirects via the global `route` function:

    // Generating URLs...
    $url = route('profile');

    // Generating Redirects...
    return redirect()->route('profile');

If the named route defines parameters, you may pass the parameters as the second argument to the `route` function. The given parameters will automatically be inserted into the URL in their correct positions:

    Route::get('user/{id}/profile', function ($id) {
        //
    })->name('profile');

    $url = route('profile', ['id' => 1]);

## Route Model Binding

When injecting a model ID to a route or controller action, you will often query to retrieve the model that corresponds to that ID. Laravel route model binding provides a convenient way to automatically inject the model instances directly into your routes. For example, instead of injecting a user's ID, you can inject the entire `User` model instance that matches the given ID.

### Implicit Binding

Laravel automatically resolves Eloquent models defined in routes or controller actions whose type-hinted variable names match a route segment name. For example:

    Route::get('api/users/{user}', function (App\User $user) {
        return $user->email;
    });

Since the `$user` variable is type-hinted as the `App\User` Eloquent model and the variable name matches the `{user}` URI segment, Laravel will automatically inject the model instance that has an ID matching the corresponding value from the request URI. If a matching model instance is not found in the database, a 404 HTTP response will automatically be generated.
