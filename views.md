## Creating Views

> Looking for more information on how to write Blade templates? Check out the full [Blade documentation](/docs/{{version}}/blade) to get started.

Views contain the HTML served by your application and separate your controller / application logic from your presentation logic. Views are stored in the `resources/views` directory. A simple view might look something like this:

    <!-- View stored in resources/views/greeting.blade.php -->

    <html>
        <body>
            <h1>Hello, {{ $name }}</h1>
        </body>
    </html>

Since this view is stored at `resources/views/greeting.blade.php`, we may return it using the global `view` helper like so:

    Route::get('/', function () {
        return view('greeting', ['name' => 'James']);
    });

As you can see, the first argument passed to the `view` helper corresponds to the name of the view file in the `resources/views` directory. The second argument is an array of data that should be made available to the view. In this case, we are passing the `name` variable, which is displayed in the view using [Blade syntax](/docs/{{version}}/blade).

Of course, views may also be nested within sub-directories of the `resources/views` directory. "Dot" notation may be used to reference nested views. For example, if your view is stored at `resources/views/admin/profile.blade.php`, you may reference it like so:

    return view('admin.profile', $data);

## Passing Data To Views

As you saw in the previous examples, you may pass an array of data to views:

    return view('greetings', ['name' => 'Victoria']);

When passing information in this manner, the data should be an array with key / value pairs. Inside your view, you can then access each value using its corresponding key, such as `<?php echo $key; ?>`. As an alternative to passing a complete array of data to the `view` helper function, you may use the `with` method to add individual pieces of data to the view:

    return view('greeting')->with('name', 'Victoria');

#### Sharing Data With All Views

Occasionally, you may need to share a piece of data with all views that are rendered by your application. You may do so using the view facade's `share` method. Typically, you should place calls to `share` within a service provider's `boot` method. You are free to add them to the `AppServiceProvider` or generate a separate service provider to house them:

    <?php

    namespace App\Providers;

    use Illuminate\Support\Facades\View;

    class AppServiceProvider extends ServiceProvider
    {
        /**
         * Bootstrap any application services.
         *
         * @return void
         */
        public function boot()
        {
            View::share('key', 'value');
        }

        /**
         * Register the service provider.
         *
         * @return void
         */
        public function register()
        {
            //
        }
    }
